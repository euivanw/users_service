# Users Service

## Objective:

This service is responsible for managing users. It provides APIs to create,
read, update, delete, and list users.

## Key Technologies:

- [Dart](https://dart.dev)
- [PostgreqSQL](https://postgresql.org)
- [Docker](https://docker.com)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)

## Creating the Docker image:

To create the Docker image, you need to have Docker installed on your system.
Navigate to the root directory of this project and run the following command:

```shell
docker build -t users-service .
```

The command will create a Docker image named `users-service` from the
Dockerfile in the root directory.

## Generating version tags:

The project uses `paulhatch/semantic-version` GitHub Actions to automatically
increment version numbers and generate tags.

It is necessary to ensure that the commit generated by the Pull Request to the
`main` branch contains the prefix below according to the type of version being
generated.

| Prefix        | Type of increment | Original version | New version |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `(MAJOR)`     | Major             | `1.0.0`          | `2.0.0`     |
| `(MINOR)`     | Minor             | `1.0.0`          | `1.1.0`     |
| `LEAVE EMPTY` | Patch             | `1.0.0`          | `1.0.1`     |

## Running the application with Docker:

Finally, run the following command in the root directory of this project:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The command will start a container from the `users-service` image, with all the
necessary environment variables configured previously.
